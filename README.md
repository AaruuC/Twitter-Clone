## Routes
Accessing localhost:8000 brings you to the splash page if no one is logged in. 
Otherwise, it redirects to the home page. There is a button on the splash page
that leads to the login/signup page. Here, you can register or login. Both 
options lead to the home page if successful. The home page has a logout button 
that redirects to the login page. You can also access profile and hashtag pages 
by clicking the profile name at the top of every tweet or any hashtag.

## Design Considerations
The tweets are given in reverse-time order so that the most recent and up-to-date
information can be viewed by the user. The most used hashtags are at the top so
the user can check the most popular tags. The user can delete their own tweets,
but not anyone else's. 

Liking or deleting a tweet from the profile or hashtag page redirects to the home
page. However, the example website also had this feature.
